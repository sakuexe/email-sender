      <h1>Email Form API</h1>

      <h2>Info</h2>
      <p>
        This API is a way for my static websites to use forms, to send emails.
        This way, I do not have to build a backend for every website that would
        only need it for sending emails.
      </p>
      <h3>Why did I make this, instead of using premade tools?</h3>
      <p>
        I wanted more experience with backend development and found myself
        needing to send emails through forms in my static websites built for
        clients. Learning ExpressJS was also something that I wanted to do, so
        this was a perfect opportunity to simultaniously learn and solve a
        problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have tried using premade solutions, but the ones that were available,
        seriously lacked customization for the emails being sent. This was a
        problem for me, since the emails sent with these providers didn't feel
        personal and in some cases, they even felt unprofessional.
        <i
          >(For example having the creator's image plastered on the email
          account that sent the messages.)</i
        >
        No, I am not kidding. So as a result, I decided to make my own solution.
      </p>
      <h3>Technologies</h3>
      <p>
        This API is built with Node.js and Express.js. It uses Nodemailer to
        send the emails. The API is hosted personally using a Ubuntu server and
        Docker containers. The code is hosted on GitHub and is publically
        available.
      </p>
      <p>
        So if you are interested, Check this project out and host it yourself. I
        will have a guide on how to do this in the Readme.md file.
