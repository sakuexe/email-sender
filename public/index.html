      <h2>Info</h2>
      <p>
        This API is a way for my static websites to use forms, to send emails.
        This way, I do not have to build a backend for every website that
        would only need it for sending emails.

    <h3>Why did I make this, instead of using premade tools?</h3>
    <p>
      I wanted more experience with backend development and found myself
      needing to send emails through forms in my static websites built for
      clients. Learning ExpressJS was also something that I wanted to do, so
      this was a perfect opportunity to simultaniously learn and solve a
      problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have tried using premade solutions, but the ones that were available,
      seriously lacked customization for the emails being sent. This was a
      problem for me, since the emails sent with these providers didn't feel
      personal and in some cases, they even felt unprofessional.
      <i>(For example having the creator's image plastered on the email
        account that sent the messages.)</i>
      No, I am not kidding. So as a result, I decided to make my own solution.
    </p>
    <h3>Technologies</h3>
    <p>
      This API is built with Node.js and Express.js. It uses Nodemailer to
      send the emails. The API is hosted personally using a Ubuntu server and
      Docker containers. The code is hosted on GitHub and is publically
      available.
    </p>
    <p>
      So if you are interested, Check this project out and host it yourself. I
      will have a guide on how to do this in the Readme.md file.
